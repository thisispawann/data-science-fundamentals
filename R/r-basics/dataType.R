# R works with numerous data types. some of the most basic types to get started are:
#   Decimal
#   whole numbers
#   Boolean values
#   Text or string values are called character

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE
#---------------------------------------------
# What's that data type?
# Do you remember that when you added 5 + "six", you got an error due to a 
# mismatch in data types? You can avoid such embarrassing situations by 
# checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with the 
# class() function, as the code in the editor shows.

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)

# Dates
date1 <- as.Date('2023-01-02')
print(date1)
print(class(date1))
